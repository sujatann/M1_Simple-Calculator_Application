The project that I would be doing will mainly stress on performing simple mathematic calculations that are required while adding,substracting,dividing,multiplying any two numbers and gives squares and cubes of any particular number that you ask for.
This project consist of a program which takes an arithmetic operator +, -, *, / and two operands from the user. Then, it performs the calculation on the two operands depending upon the operator entered by the user.

#  Requirements

## High level Requirements
* Able to perform operations such as,
1. Addition.
2. Substraction.
3. Multiplication.
4. Division.
5. Square.
6. Cube.


## Low level Requirements
1. Taking the two numbers to do any operation.
2. A code is written where different commands are used for different operations.
3. In case of squaring and cubing a number take only one number as an input.
4. The answer must be displayed on the screen.

##  SWOT Analysis
 1. Strength 
 *  Capable of adding,substracting,dividing,multiplying any two numbers and gives squares and cubes of any particular number that you ask for.

 2. Weakness
 * As the main intension is to work with two numbers provided more will not be supported.

 3. Opportunities
 * In the basic step to make someone understand the  simple operations of mathematics it is most useful one.

 4. Threat
 * Will not ask for more than two numbers.

 ##	5W’s and 1 How

•	When to use is in need of the requirement of basic calculations.
•	Where:  can be in schools, working place, counters etc.
•	Why can be stated in case to know the exact calculations.
•	Who is someone who wants to take use of it and find solution for their problems.
•	What is by using numbers in the calculator.
•	How is by taking two numbers as input and  carrying out any operation of the choice.
